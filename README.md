# Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to try to attempt to preserve as much media about Ukraine as possible. To this end I envision this repository consisting mainly of two things. 

1. Tooling: To collect media in as raw a form as possible, organize this data, data deduplication, and provide additional tooling for interrogating this data for insights in the future. This list is not exhaustive. 
2. Actual data

# Background motivating initial goal
I've been learning Ukrainian for a while. Currently, I read Zelensky's posts in Telegram each day. I miss a good chunk of them and I began to worry that it would be possible that all of those communications could potentially be lost in the future. Aside from personal reasons this could be bad for the historical records. 


# To Potential Contributors
This can be a very large undertaking if the goal is to be as exhaustive as possible. Initially a lot of scraping, data export, etc. tooling will be needed. To avoid imposing structure too early I won't lay out any guidelines on how this tooling should work. If you have ideas or questions, let's discuss them in an [Issue](https://github.com/ethanwillis/ukraine-media/issues). I think it's obvious that where possible being able to tag new data with the retrieval date is a good idea. Or at minimum this repository itself can keep track of that information if the tooling is able to be run on a schedule.
